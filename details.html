					<h1>IST Assignment </h1>
					<p>What I have enjoyed about the course:<br>
 					I have really enjoyed this course because I find the content really fun,<br>
 					It is a good break from a lot of the work i've been doing in other classes<br>
 					and expanding my HTML/CSS knowledge is really helpful</p>

					<p>What parts I found challenging/frustrating:<br>
 					I found a lot of grok work felt very repetitive and slow as well as the<br>
 					fact that spelling mistakes in the actual text would stuff up the whole<br>
 					Grok marking system<br>
 					I also struggled with certain CSS elements and making dropdown menus.<br>
 					The image that I have included on my website is the Grok unit that I really<br>
 					struggled with.</p>

					<p>Would you do things differently if you were starting again<br>
 					I would finish the Grok work faster so I would have more time<br>
 					for the assessment</p>

					<p>Are you pleased with your effort and progress?<br>
 					I feel like if I had more time I could have done<br>
 					better and made my website more deep and complex.</p>

					<p>What could you do to improve your progress next time?<br>
 					Take less time to do Grok and do more work on it at home.</p>

					<p>Did you use your time effectively/productively?<br>
 					Admittedly, I could have been more effective with my time management.<br>

					<p>And any other points that you feel are relevant?<br>
					So far IST had been really fun and I feel that it<br>
					will actually be useful later in life, compared to some<br>
					other subjects</p>

					<p>(the google logo text is a standart hyperlink for a specific reason and not because I don't<br>
						know how to change it, to do that you would do a  --  a { code here}  --  in your css<br>
						I made it that because it would make it clear where you click)
